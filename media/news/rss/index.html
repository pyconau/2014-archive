      <title>Final weekend for Dinner tickets</title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/52</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;re passing along numbers to our &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bcec.com.au/&#34;&gt;venue&lt;/a&gt; for catering on Monday, so this is your last weekend to grab tickets for our conference dinner! As well as fine food and company, we have an important speaker lined up, &lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/50&#34;&gt;Paul Gampe&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Get along to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/registration/new&#34;&gt;registration page&lt;/a&gt; and be sure to select dinner as one of the options. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;d also like to know if you&#39;re coming along to the sprints so we can cater for them appropriately, please head along to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10J1wDErm9iVWWx3CDbibSOTq_nxeom4oas1Gap1S3VY/edit&#34;&gt;handy-dandy form&lt;/a&gt; and let us know!

      <title>Dinner Speaker: Paul Gampe</title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/50</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Netwhois. logfilerotate. logfileradius. What do these three things have in
common? They were all written in Perl by Paul Gampe to solve problems faced by
ISPs in the 90s. Those are problems he would know about, being the man who
connected Japan to the internet.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style=&#34;float: right; padding: 10px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/news/PaulGampe.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
Paul Gampe’s dinner talk is entitled “The Rise and Fall of Perl: Lessons for
Python from an old Perl guy”. Paul will share war stories from his long career
in open source software, illustrating how Perl got big by being the language
of choice for solving a wide range of software problems. Paul believes that
Python now fills that role, and sounds a cautionary note, warning that “If you
forget where you came from, you might wind up like Java”.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He will also draw on experience gained through his involvement with Open
Source Industry Australia (OSIA), especially in preparing a response to the
proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. Paul knows first-hand about the need to be
ever vigilant of the complexity of these multilateral agreements that have
immense challenges for an economy such as Australia’s, which needs to preserve
the existing flexibilities and freedoms Australians enjoy under our own legal
frameworks.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Paul Gampe currently directs information management, security, applications
and software development, communications technology and service management for
Australia’s leading Data-Centre-as-a-Service (DCaaS) provider, NEXTDC Limited.
Before that, Paul was Vice President of World-Wide Engineering Services and
Operations for Red Hat, where he directed a global function delivering
software engineering services and pioneered development of Red Hat’s Asian
language products. You might have seen him at linux.conf.au talking about how
to make money from open source software.

      <title>DjangoGirls: Free programming workshop for women</title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/51</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following the success of the amazing DjangoGirls at Euro Python, we&#39;re running a workshop on the first day of sprints.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div style=&#34;float: right; padding: 10px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/news/djangogirls.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
So come along to pick up an Open Source project to work on in a supportive environment or just sprint with other girl programmers for the day. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No Django experience is required just an interest in learning. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There&#39;ll be cupcakes and excellent coaches/mentors. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
We&#39;d love to have anyone who identifies as a women to come along! 
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Keynote: Dr James R. Curran</title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/49</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up &lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/46&#34;&gt;last week’s announcement that Katie Cunningham would be one of PyCon 2014’s plenary speakers&lt;/a&gt; was always going to be hard. We love a challenge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float: right; padding: 10px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/news/curran.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So it is with equally great excitement that we announce the second of our keynote speakers: Dr James R. Curran, Associate Professor and ARC Australian Research Fellow at the University of Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of people in the Australian Python community who got their start in Python through James’ activities: He has taught Python to thousands of school students and teachers since version 1.5.1 (1999), and for over 10 years he has been involved in a wide range of high school outreach activities, primarily through the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncss.edu.au&#34;&gt;National Computer Science School&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his talk, &lt;em&gt;“Python for every child in Australia”&lt;/em&gt;, Dr Curran casts his eyes over an important opportunity to bring Python into classrooms all over Australia. The once in a generation &lt;em&gt;“Australian Curriculum: Digital Technologies”&lt;/em&gt; curriculum presents an opportunity to teach computer science and programming to Australian school children from Year 3 to Year 10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;James argues that the very future of Australian computing is at stake, and that the Python community has an exciting part to play in shaping that future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from his Python outreach work, James is a computer scientist at the University of Sydney, researching computational linguistics with a focus on statistical approaches to syntactic and semantic natural language processing on web-scale datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to hear Dr Curran’s keynote address and see his vision for the future of Python in Australian schools. Will you be there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registrations for PyCon Australia 2014 are already open and tickets going at alarming rate (the good kind of alarming). Book your conference ticket today! &lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/register/prices&#34;&gt;http://2014.pycon-au.org/register/prices&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Call for Volunteers</title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/47</link>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;c0&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;PyCon Australia is organized and run by
volunteers from the Python community. This year we&#39;re looking for
over 200 on-site volunteer hours to help make sure everything runs
smoothly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0 c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Everyone who is attending PyCon Australia is
welcome to volunteer, but you must be registered to volunteer.
There will be discounts given for people who can give us a minimum
of 1 full day of help.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All volunteers will be given the necessary
training required to do the various jobs at PyCon Australia.
Because some jobs will require more training than others there will
be a number of training sessions held in the lead-up to PyCon
Australia (every Sunday from now until the conference).
Unfortunately this means certain jobs will need to be filled by
people who can attend those training days.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0 c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone who puts their hand up to volunteer -
regardless of how much they contribute - will be entitled to attend
the volunteers after-party on Sunday night. The event is to show
our appreciation to the volunteers for your hard work. You can
expect some free drinks and food!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0 c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;To register as a volunteer, please fill-out the
question form at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;c13&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;c8&#34; href=

&lt;p class=&#34;c0 c1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;c0&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;All help is very much appreciated. Thank
you!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Keynote:  Katie Cunningham</title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/46</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Last week, we revealed the programme schedule for Pycon Australia 2014 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule&#34;&gt;2014.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule&lt;/a&gt;). Such an impressive line-up of talks we are fronting this year, we couldn&#39;t be more proud. Kicking off proceedings are, of course, our plenary speakers and we are absolutely thrilled to have Katie Cunningham deliver a keynote at PyCon Australia 2014.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;float: right; padding: 10px;&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;/img/news/cunningham.jpg&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Katie is no stranger to Python conferences. A prolific speaker and advocate for accessibility, she has taken the stage at several PyCon and Django conferences. This year, her keynote titled &#34;Accessibility: Myths and Delusions&#34; will invite us to look at accessibility from a usability perspective. Whether you are developer, designer or content creator, Katie&#39;s talk will challenge you to question the online experience your website is really delivering.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Accessibility is very close to her heart and she defines it simply as &#34;all of the data and all of the functionality for all of the users.&#34; Katie adds, &#34;Accessibility is one of the least understood areas of modern UI/UX, most often resulting in a below-par experience for users with different needs. Myths and delusions about creating an accessible interface are everywhere and it&#39;s time we change that.&#34; In her talk, Katie will debunk some common misconceptions surrounding accessibility, the tools, compliance, impact on the audience and examine effort vs. cost considerations.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Katie lives and breathes Python, Django and Open Source. Her job as Python developer at Cox Media Group is just the tip of the iceberg. A true champion for diversity and inclusivity, she nurtures PyLadies in her hometown of Washington DC as well as co-founding Young Coders. She is also an author, working on her third book. She writes at &lt;a href=&#34;http://therealkatie.net&#34;&gt;therealkatie.net&lt;/a&gt; and tweets at &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/kcunning&#34;&gt;@kcunning&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We can&#39;t wait to hear Katie&#39;s keynote and we are sure you will enjoy it as well. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Registrations for PyCon Australia 2014 are already open and tickets are flying fast. Our t-shirt printing deadline is coming up in a little over a week, to ensure you get your t-shirt, book your conference ticket today, visit: &lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/register/prices&#34;&gt;2014.pycon-au.org/register/prices&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>PyCon Australia 2014 has revealed its programme! </title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/40</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia is very proud to be able to reveal our programme for
the 2014 conference, to be held on Saturday 2 and Sunday 3 August
2014, following our Miniconfs on Friday 1 August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following a record-breaking response to our Call for Proposals, the
conference will feature three full tracks of presentations, across two
days, covering all aspects of the Python ecosystem, presented by
experts and core developers of key Python technology. Our presenters
cover a broad range of backgrounds, including industry, research,
government and academia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia is a great place to keep up-to-date with the latest
trends in Python web technology: Django lead developer, Simon Willison
will be presenting &#34;A new default web stack&#34;.  We have many experts in
their fields, including CPython core developer, and Brisbane local,
Nick Coghlan who will present some &#34;elegant and ugly hacks in
CPython&#34;.

&lt;p&gt;As well as DjangoCon AU and the OpenStack miniconf, the main
conference will feature talks on testing, deployment, and optimisation
of Python-based web apps. For the first time this year we&#39;re also
having a miniconf dedicated to talks on using Python in the Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year, talks on growing the Python Community make up a large
amount of our programme, with &#34;The Curse of the Django Podcast&#34; by
Elena Williams exploring the role of community-driven media, and Anna
Gerber&#39;s &#34;PyBots! or how to learn to stop worrying and love coding&#34;
covering approaches to Python in education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve also made sure that beginners, or people looking to brush up on
their Python skillset, have a clear path through the conference.
Starting with Peter Lovett&#39;s &#34;Python 101+&#34; tutorial, you can rapidly
enhance your knowledge of Python, and then you can attend our general
stream talks to glean a snapshot of the state of the art in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full schedule for PyCon Australia 2014 can be found at
&lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule&#34;&gt;http://2014.pycon-au.org/programme/schedule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registrations for PyCon Australia 2014 are now open, with prices
starting at AU$50 for students, and tickets for the general public
starting at AU$220. All prices include GST, and more information can

      <title>Financial Aid applications now open</title>
      <link>http://2014.pycon-au.org/media/news/38</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following in the footsteps of PyCon North America, PyCon Australia offers a generous financial aid programme, so that some attendees and speakers have some, or in rare cases, all of their expenses such as flight, hotel and admission provided to them from the conference budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PyCon Australia strongly encourages people to apply for financial aid -- even if we can’t cover all of your expenses, we will give you free admission based on need. The application process is simple, and straight­for­ward. It’s also very liberal -- the only caveat is that speakers at the conference &#34;get bumped to the top&#34; of the applications so that we don’t lose a good talk because of financial need. We also don’t ban anyone from applying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the financial aid programme is the PyCon Outreach programme -- it&#39;s the community holding up the community and making itself accessible at this major event through these financial grants. It is the very spirit of the conference; make the information, knowledge, friendships and connection available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The generous contribution of the Python Software Foundation has helped us in offering this programme. Financial aid is core to the mission of the PSF -- The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/&#34;&gt;http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/&lt;/a&gt;) and international community of Python programmers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For full details of the financial aid programme, and details on how to apply, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://2014.pycon-au.org/grants&#34;&gt;http://2014.pycon-au.org/grants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
