          <p class="description">Perhaps There Is A Better Way</p>
      <p class="description">In this talk, we will first agree to commonly accepted goals of software
        development, then critique the tools by which we come to arrive at those goals.
        We will be exploring tools and associated nomenclature that we may have never
        seen or used before, so that you may later investigate further and develop an
        understanding and opinion.</p>

      <p class="description">Subjects covered in detail include functional programming, abstraction and
        parametricity.</p>

      <p class="description">We will also take a glance at some of the doo-doo that is written on the
        internet about these subjects, so as to keep in check our means of critical
        inquiry.

              Retrospective</span>
          </div>
          <p class="description">A year and a half ago, work to integrate
            migrations into Django itself started, and the 1.7 release
            contains the results of that effort - though not everything went
            according to plan. Learn about how the new migration system was
            designed, why things are laid out like they are, and the
            unexpected problems that came up during the 1.7 release
            cycle.</p>

            <span class="meta">Class-based Views: <br />Past, Present and Future</span>
          </div>
          <p class="description">One of the big changes in Django 1.3 was
            the introduction of Class-Based Views. Opinion on them is
            strongly divided; some love them, some hate them.<br /><br />
            In this talk, we'll look at the history that led to the
            development of Class-Based Views, and the current state of play.
            We'll look at some interesting design patterns that are possible
            by exploiting the features of Class-Based views. And we'll look
            to what the future could hold for Django's Class-based
            future.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="description">Managing transactions in Django has been
            considered a black art, but the state of the black art has
            improved considerably with each new release. We'll talk about
            the best ways of managing transactions in your Django app,
            including pre-1.6 and 1.6 and later feature sets. Included in
            the discussion will be database-specific features (mostly
            PostgreSQL), and an overview of some advanced topics such as
            transaction isolation modes and two-phase commit.</p>

            <span class="meta">Using Django, Tasty Pie, and lxml for the
              Digital Humanities</span>
          </div>
          <p class="description">Digital Humanities is the application of
            computer technology or computer-based quantitive methods to the
            problems and data of the disciplines of the Humanities. This
            paper will details some of the lessons learned by a recovering
            Java and C programmer in implementing a new Digital Humanities
            project on the Django platform. Using experience gleaned from
            two decades of programming experience and an ongoing PhD
            candidature in Classics and Ancient History, it will detail some
            of the gaps that need to be bridged between the two worlds and
            how Python APIs like Django and lxml can be used to bridge them,
            as well as what remains currently unsolved. It will also explore
            how the Tasty Pie REST framework for Django can be leveraged to
            solve particular types of problems in the Digital Humanities in
            creating textual annotations and linked data sets.</p>

            <span class="meta">Writing Reusable Django
              Apps</span>
          </div>
          <p class="description">As Django developers we use a multitude of reusable apps that solve common problems that we all face, to help us ship features faster. Sometimes, you face a problem that leaves you thinking "surely someone has written an app for this", but you can't find anything. This is when you want to start writing your own reusable app.</p>

      <p class="description">This talk will have a look at some of the best existing reusable apps and see what lessons can be learnt from them, then walk through every facet of developing a reusable and discuss the best practises that have emerged.</p>

      <p class="description">You can expect to walk away from this talk with all the knowledge you need to go and write your first reusable app.</p>
