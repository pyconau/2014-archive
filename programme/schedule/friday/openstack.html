        <strong><a name="openstack_identity_and_federation"></a>#OpenStack Identity and Federation</strong><br/>
        <em>(Jamie Lennox, Red Hat)</em></p>
<p>
            Keystone is the central authentication and authorization point for OpenStack.<br/>
            It already handles managing users via LDAP and SQL, however, as OpenStack and the number of possible identity sources grows, Keystone is evolving to rely primarily on external sources of identity using protocols like SAML. Keystone&#8217;s role then becomes one of pure authorization and mapping those identities into an OpenStack context.
        </p>
<p>
            For the unfamiliar, we&#8217;ll start with a quick recap of the role of Keystone and<br/>
            the permission models of OpenStack, then look at the challenges of handling<br/>
            many distinct authentication sources and the in-development changes required<br/>
            for federated identity providers.
        </p>

            Jamie is Australia&#8217;s Keystone core developer working for Red Hat in Brisbane and<br/>
            currently the primary developer on Kite. He enjoys tinkering with anything<br/>
            security related, and has recently been involved making the client side of OpenStack more usable for developers.<br/>

        <strong><a name="pbr"></a>#Python Build Reasonableness and Semantic Versioning</strong><br/>
        <em>(Robert Collins, HP)</em></p>
<p>
            Semver and Python with PBR<br/>
            PBR &#8211; Python Build Reasonableness<br/>
            PBR is a setuptools plugin which OpenStack developed to provide simple and consistent minimal-boilerplate build definitions for its projects.  Now used by all the OpenStack projects, PBR provides integration glue for core features:</p>
<p>                    &#8211; testing<br/>
            &#8211; binary package creation for Linux distributors<br/>
            &#8211; inclusion of files in tarballs<br/>
            &#8211; changelog and authors file creation<br/>
            &#8211; pypi summary creation<br/>
            &#8211; version number creation<br/>
            &#8211; sphinx doc stub creation and manpage enablement<br/>
            &#8211; unified requirements management &#8211; for both easy-install and pip with single-file control</p>
<p>                    The most interesting part is the version number creation, since coming up with the right version number can be a contentious discussion in some projects. Semver provides simple and robust rules for deciding on version numbers, and I&#8217;m in the middle of implementing automation for these in PBR itself, with integration glue to export them in PEP-440, dpkg and rpm format. The only dependencies PBR has are git + a recent pip, so this should be useful for many attendees &#8211; and while PBR is an OpenStack invention we&#8217;re very interested in making sure its useful and reliable for anyone that wants to use it.

        <strong><a name="tempest"></a>#Tempest: OpenStack Integrated Testing</strong><br/>
        <em>(Matthew Treinish, HP)</em></p>
<p>
            Tempest is OpenStack&#8217;s integrated test suite which aims to provide validation that OpenStack is working. As such it is run as a gating on job on all proposed commits to OpenStack. It is designed to run against an operational OpenStack cloud, which includes everything from a devstack deployment to a public cloud. Tempest originally started as just a small number of integration tests to verify that the various OpenStack projects worked together. It has since grown into one of the top 5 most active OpenStack projects with several different classes of testing and validation.
        </p>
<p>                This talk will provide an overview of what Tempest is and how it works. Providing an explanation of the philosophy behind the project, and insight into why things are setup a certain way. Additionally, it will cover some of the features in tempest and how to configure and run it locally with or without devstack.</p>
<p><em><br/>
            Matthew Treinish is a part of the HP OpenStack team working to make OpenStack better. He&#8217;s been an active contributor to OpenStack since the Folsom cycle. He is the QA program PTL for the Juno development cycle, a core contributor on Tempest, elastic-recheck, and a couple of smaller projects and a member of the stable-maint team.</em>

        <strong><a name="zerovm_and_swift"></a>#Changing the world with ZeroVM and Swift</strong><br/>
        <em>(Jakub Krajcovic, Rackspace Australia)</em></p>
<p>
            ZeroVM is a new generation of virtualization. It provides a secure sandbox for executing code and is able to spawn in under 5ms. It natively supports python execution out of the box.
        </p>
<p>
            This talk aims to outline how ZeroVM and Swift can start changing how we fundamentally think about computing and the consumption of IT resources. ZeroVM could be thought of as a &#8220;&#8221;micro-hypervisor&#8221;&#8221; that creates a sandboxed environment for code execution and through python middleware can run natively on top of a Swift storage cluster. This talk will present ZeroVM, describe about how it plugs into Swift and what capabilities the combination of these technologies opens.
        </p>
<p>
            The most immediate &#8220;&#8221;killer apps&#8221;&#8221; that the Swift+ZeroVM combination offers are in data processing:<br/>
            &#8211; oil, geo, mining<br/>
            &#8211; TV and movies<br/>
            &#8211; photo and picture processing
        </p>
<p>
            Some less obvious but even more interesting are things like the possibility to completely redesign an SQL DB and create a structured query language that processes binary unstructured data instead of rows and columns.
        </p>

        <em>(Anita Kuno, HP)</em></p>
<p>
OpenStack generates a lot of log files in its testing process. Learn how to find and identify common patterns in log files from a member of the OpenStack Infrastructure team. Understand the different kinds of log files to expect, how to evaluate them to find why your patch is failing and what steps to take when you identify the failure. Learn how to search for bugs and how to file a bug report. Understanding the value that elastic-recheck provides will also be covered.

        <strong><a name="identifying_race_conditions"></a>#Large Scale Identification of Race Conditions (In OpenStack CI)</strong><br/>
        <em>(Joseph Gordon, HP)</em></p>
<p>
&#8220;Does your project have a CI system that suffers from an ever-growing set of race conditions? We have the tool for you: it has enabled increased velocity despite project growth.</p>
<p>When talking about the GNU HURD kernel, Richard Stallman once said, &#8220;it turned out that debugging these asynchronous multithreaded programs was really hard.&#8221; With 30+ asynchronous services developed by over 1000 people the OpenStack project is an object lesson of this problem. One of the consequences is race conditions often leak into code with no obvious defect. Just before OpenStackâ€™s most recent stable release we were pushing the boundaries of what was possible with manual tracking of race conditions. To address this problem we have developed an ElasticSearch based toolchain called &#8220;elastic-recheck.&#8221; This helps us track race conditions so developers can fix them and identify when CI failures are related to the failed patch or are due to a known pre-existing race condition. Automated tracking of over 70 specific race conditions has allowed us to quickly determine which bugs are hurting us the most, allowing us to prioritize debugging efforts. Immediate and automated classification of test failures into genuine and false failures has saved countless hours that would have been wasted digging through the over 350MBs of logs produced by a single test run.&#8221;
